## ðŸ“Š Data Types in PHP
In PHP, data types are classifications that specify what kind of data a variable can hold. PHP is a loosely typed language, meaning variables do not need to be explicitly declared with a type; PHP will automatically determine the data type based on the assigned value. Here are the primary data types in PHP:
## 1. ðŸ”¢ Integer
An integer is a non-decimal number (whole number) that can be positive, negative, or zero.
```php
$age = 25; // Integer
```
## 2. ðŸ”¬ Float (or Double)
A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.
```php
$name = "John Doe"; // String
```
## 4. âœ… Boolean
   A boolean represents a true or false value. Itâ€™s often used in conditional statements.
```php
$isStudent = true; // Boolean
$isAdmin = false; // Boolean
```
## 5. ðŸ“‹ Array
An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable. There are three types of arrays in PHP:
1. Indexed arrays (numerically indexed)
2. Associative arrays (key-value pairs)
3. Multidimensional arrays (arrays within arrays)
```php
// Indexed array
$fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange"];

// Associative array
$person = ["name" => "Alice", "age" => 30];

// Multidimensional array
$matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];
```
## 6. ðŸ‘¤ Object
An object is an instance of a class. PHP supports object-oriented programming (OOP), so you can define classes with properties and methods and create objects based on these classes
```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;

    public function __construct($make, $model) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
    }
}

$myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla"); // Object

```
## 7. ðŸ§± NULL
NULL represents a variable with no value. Itâ€™s used to explicitly set a variable to "no value" or "empty".
```php
$noValue = NULL; // NULL
```
## 8. ðŸ”§ Resource
A resource is a special variable that holds a reference to an external resource, such as a file, database connection, or stream. Resources are usually created by functions that interact with system-level resources. 
```php
$file = fopen("test.txt", "r"); // Resource
```
