# 💬 Comments in Programming

In programming, **comments** are lines in the code that are not executed by the compiler or interpreter. They serve as **annotations** to explain, document, or clarify the code, making it easier for developers (including yourself and others) to understand and maintain it over time.

## 🤔 Why Use Comments?
Comments are useful for:
- 📝 **Explaining complex code logic** for future reference.
- 📌 **Providing context** to certain sections of code, such as why a specific approach was chosen.
- 🔖 **Adding reminders** for future updates or bug fixes.
- 👀 **Making the code readable** and understandable for other developers who may work on it later.

## 🐘 Comments in PHP

In PHP, there are three main types of comments:

### 1. 🖊️ Single-line Comment
A single-line comment is used for brief explanations and is denoted by either `//` or `#`.

```php
// This is a single-line comment using //
# This is another single-line comment using #
```
## 2. 📜 Multi-line Comment
Multi-line comments are used for longer explanations and span multiple lines. They start with /* and end with */.
```php
/*
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
*/
````
## 3. 📚 Documentation Comment
Documentation comments are special comments used to document functions, classes, or methods. In PHP, they begin with /** and end with */. They are often used by PHPDoc, a documentation generator.
```php
/**
 * 📈 Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *
 * @param int $a First number.
 * @param int $b Second number.
 * @return int Sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}
```
